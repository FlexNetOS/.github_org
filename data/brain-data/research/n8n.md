# Research: n8n

**Status:** Pre-adoption research. **Already forked** to FlexNetOS/n8n; only path normalization and branch setup remain.
**Action gated by this dossier:** Set up `develop` branch on FlexNetOS/n8n, replace `repos/n8n/` plain clone with submodule at `repos/forked/n8n/`, add MANIFEST entry.

**Cross-reference:** Matches [my-github-reconciliation.md](my-github-reconciliation.md) D1 — n8n is the highest-priority "do-not-destroy" case. Expected G3a exit: 0 (SAFE — origin already FlexNetOS/n8n, matches MANIFEST upstream pattern).

## 2. Purpose

> *"n8n - Secure Workflow Automation for Technical Teams. n8n is a workflow automation platform that gives technical teams the flexibility of code with the speed of no-code. With 400+ integrations, native AI capabilities, and a fair-code license, n8n lets you build powerful automations while maintaining full control over your data and deployments."*

Monorepo packaged as `n8n-monorepo` (version 2.23.0). 400+ integrations, native AI nodes (LangChain-based), fair-code license. Editor at http://localhost:5678.

**Code vs README verdict:** Code matches the README's claims. The `npx n8n` quick-start in README is for **end users installing from npm**, not for contributors building from source — see §12 for the nuance. AI/LangChain nodes confirmed in `packages/@n8n/nodes-langchain/`. PostHog + RudderStack telemetry is wired into startup (not disclosed in README quick-start).

## 3. Stack inventory

### Package manager / build
- **Package manager:** `pnpm` (enforced — `preinstall` script `block-npm-install.js` blocks `npm install`)
- **Lock file:** `pnpm-lock.yaml` (1.4 MB)
- **Build orchestration:** Turbo (`turbo run build` / `turbo run dev --parallel`)
- **Monorepo structure:** pnpm workspaces under `packages/`

### Runtime requirements (from code)
| Tool | `engines` field | CONTRIBUTING says |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Node.js | `>=22.22` | "version 24 or newer" |
| pnpm | `>=10.22.0` | `pnpm@10.22.0` via corepack |

### Key scripts (from package.json)
| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm install` | Install all workspace deps (blocks npm) |
| `pnpm build` | `turbo run build` — full monorepo build |
| `pnpm dev` | `turbo run dev --parallel` — full-stack hot reload |
| `pnpm dev:be` | Backend only (excludes design-system, chat, task-runner, editor-ui) |
| `pnpm dev:fe` | Frontend only (editor-ui + design-system) |
| `pnpm dev:ai` | AI nodes only (langchain + n8n + n8n-core) |
| `pnpm start` | `node scripts/os-normalize.mjs --dir packages/cli/bin n8n` |
| `pnpm test` | `turbo run test` (Jest for backend, Vitest for frontend, Playwright for E2E) |
| `pnpm lint` | `turbo run lint` (Biome + ESLint) |
| `pnpm typecheck` | `turbo run typecheck` |

### Key packages
| Package | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `packages/cli` | Express server, REST API, CLI commands |
| `packages/core` | Workflow execution engine |
| `packages/workflow` | Core workflow interfaces/types |
| `packages/editor-ui` | Vue 3 frontend (Pinia state, Vite build) |
| `packages/nodes-base` | 400+ built-in integration nodes |
| `packages/@n8n/nodes-langchain` | AI/LangChain nodes |
| `packages/@n8n/instance-ai` | AI assistant backend |
| `packages/@n8n/design-system` | Vue component library |
| `packages/@n8n/config` | Centralized config management (`@Env()` decorators) |
| `packages/@n8n/api-types` | Shared TS interfaces (FE ↔ BE) |

### Technology stack
- **Frontend:** Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite + Pinia + Storybook
- **Backend:** Node.js + TypeScript + Express + TypeORM
- **Database:** TypeORM — SQLite (default) or PostgreSQL
- **Testing:** Jest (unit/backend), Vitest (frontend), Playwright (E2E)
- **Code quality:** Biome (formatting) + ESLint + lefthook git hooks
- **DI container:** `@n8n/di` (IoC)
- **Feature flags:** PostHog
- **Telemetry:** PostHog + RudderStack (wired into base-command startup; can be disabled)

### Env vars (from `.env.local.example` + code scan)
| Var | Required? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `N8N_USER_FOLDER` | optional | Local data folder |
| `N8N_LICENSE_TENANT_ID` | optional | For Enterprise license SDK |
| `N8N_LICENSE_ACTIVATION_KEY` | optional | Enterprise activation key |
| `N8N_LICENSE_CERT` | optional | Ephemeral Enterprise cert |
| `N8N_AI_ENABLED` | optional | Enables AI features globally |
| `N8N_AI_ASSISTANT_BASE_URL` | optional | AI assistant service URL |
| `N8N_AI_ANTHROPIC_KEY` | optional | Claude API key for AI workflow builder |
| `LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT` / `LANGSMITH_PROJECT` / `LANGSMITH_TRACING` | optional | LangSmith tracing (LangChain SDK) |

Env file name is **`.env.local.example`** (not `.env.example`) — copy to `.env.local`, load with `pnpm exec dotenvx run -f .env.local -- <cmd>`.

### Required services / ports
- Port **5678** — n8n editor UI
- Database: SQLite by default (file-based); PostgreSQL optional
- Redis: needed for queue mode and multi-main only
- Mailpit: E2E tests only

### Security flags
- **Telemetry ON by default:** PostHog (`packages/cli/src/commands/base-command.ts`) + RudderStack proxy wired at startup. Can be disabled via config.
- **`.ee.` files Enterprise-only:** source under EE license, not SUL.
- No hardcoded credentials found in scan.
- n8n ships Claude (`N8N_AI_ANTHROPIC_KEY`) and LangSmith integrations — those keys come from env, not hardcoded.

## 4. License caveat (READ BEFORE ADOPTING)

**Dual license:**
- Files containing `.ee.` in filename or `.ee` in dirname → **n8n Enterprise License** (`LICENSE_EE.md`). These are NOT licensed under SUL and require a paid Enterprise key to use.
- Everything else → **Sustainable Use License (SUL)** — permits self-hosting and internal use; **restricts SaaS/hosted offerings** that compete with n8n's cloud product.
- Third-party components retain their own licenses.
- **Branches other than `master` are explicitly unlicensed** (stated verbatim in `LICENSE.md` first paragraph).

**For FlexNetOS intent (internal automation only):** SUL is permissive enough. Hosted/SaaS use requires legal review.

## 5. FlexNetOS-side intent

Fits the umbrella's "workflow automation" role:
- Drive cross-repo automation that doesn't fit GitHub Actions
  (long-running, external API orchestration, scheduled jobs).
- Native AI node integration for the FlexNetOS agent fleet.
- Potential to wire into `mempalace`, `ruvector`, `understand-anything`
  via custom nodes.

## 6. Pre-adoption audit

- [x] Fork already at `FlexNetOS/n8n`. **No `gh repo fork` needed.**
- [x] `upstream` remote wired locally in `repos/n8n/`.
- [x] License reviewed — SUL for internal use is acceptable; EE files need Enterprise key.
- [x] Active upstream — very active (thousands of branches, frequent commits, 2.23.0 current).
- [ ] No `develop` branch yet. Must create from `origin/master` before adoption.
- [x] Build verified: `node packages/cli/bin/n8n --version` → `2.23.0` ✓ (node_modules installed, CLI dist built).
- [x] Upstream uses `master`, not `main`. Fork workflow adapts accordingly.
- [x] Telemetry present and ON by default — expected for this project; can be disabled.
- [ ] Sync cadence not agreed — see §10.

## 7. Adoption plan

Case: **already forked — just normalize**.

1. Create `develop` branch and push to fork:
   ```bash
   cd repos/n8n
   git fetch upstream master
   git checkout master && git merge --ff-only upstream/master
   git push origin master                       # mirror upstream
   git checkout -b develop origin/master 2>/dev/null || git checkout develop
   git push -u origin develop
   ```
2. Replace plain clone with submodule:
   ```bash
   # From umbrella root
   rm -rf repos/n8n
   mkdir -p repos/forked
   git submodule add --depth=1 -b develop \
       https://github.com/FlexNetOS/n8n.git \
       repos/forked/n8n
   cd repos/forked/n8n
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n.git
   ```
3. MANIFEST entry (FORKED section):
   ```yaml
   - path: repos/forked/n8n
     url: https://github.com/FlexNetOS/n8n
     upstream: https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n
     branch: develop
     toolchain: [node, pnpm, docker]
     groups: [forked, automation, workflow]
     notes: |
       Workflow automation platform (fair-code SUL license — see
       LICENSE.md). Upstream uses `master`; fork's `master` mirrors
       upstream, `develop` carries FlexNetOS changes.
   ```
4. Phase B (org-only rename) on `develop`:
   - `.github/CODEOWNERS`: add `* @FlexNetOS/maintainers`
   - Branch protection on `master` (mirror): linear history, block direct pushes
   - Branch protection on `develop`: PR + 1 review
   - `.github/FUNDING.yml`: copy from umbrella
   - `.github/FLEXNETOS-ENV.md`: env-scaffold pointer
   - `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: thin caller using umbrella reusables
5. Skip Phase D for upstream's `.env.local.example` — leave alone.

## 8. Sync risk

**Medium.** Upstream very active:
- `package.json` changes most weeks (versions, deps). We never edit it → fast-forward.
- Upstream `.github/workflows/` may change. Our caller has different filename (`ci.yml`) → no conflict.
- Big refactors in upstream's `packages/` could create textual conflicts
  on our `develop` if we have commits in same files. Mitigate: keep
  FlexNetOS commits scoped to **new files** or clearly-owned dirs.
- Node/pnpm engine bumps happen regularly — track them.

## 9. Verification

Phase 3 setup **CONFIRMED** (2026-05-28):

| Step | Command | Exit | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Env file | `cp .env.local.example .env.local` | 0 | ✓ `.env.local` created |
| node_modules | (pre-existing) | — | ✓ Already installed |
| CLI dist | (pre-existing) | — | ✓ `packages/cli/dist/` present |
| Smoke test | `node packages/cli/bin/n8n --version` | 0 | ✓ `2.23.0` |

Toolchain at verification time: Node v24.15.0, pnpm 11.4.0 (host), `packageManager` pinned to `pnpm@10.32.1` (corepack will enforce in-project).

For future setup from scratch:
```bash
# From repos/n8n/ (or repos/forked/n8n/ after submodule migration):
corepack enable
pnpm install          # corepack enforces pnpm 10.32.1 from packageManager field
pnpm build > build.log 2>&1
tail -20 build.log    # check for errors
node packages/cli/bin/n8n --version   # smoke test
```

## 10. Open decisions for user ~~DO NOT FORK UNTIL SOURCE CLONE IS PROPERLY SET UP~~ **ALL DECISIONS RESOLVED ✓ — adoption cleared**

- [x] **License:** SUL approved for FlexNetOS internal-automation use case.
- [x] **Sync cadence:** as-needed (not scheduled). Manual bumps via `make submodules.bump`.
- [x] **Local changes:** none in repos/n8n/ (clean HEAD, no FlexNetOS-side commits).
- [x] **Telemetry:** free tier only — PostHog/RudderStack remain on but no paid features.
- [x] **EE files:** local-host-only, all-free community setup. No Enterprise license needed; `.ee.` code paths stay dormant.

## 11. Decision log

| Date | Decision | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-05-28 | License: SUL approved | Internal automation use only |
| 2026-05-28 | Sync cadence: as-needed | `make submodules.bump GROUP=forked NAME=n8n` when needed |
| 2026-05-28 | Telemetry: free tier | PostHog/RudderStack enabled, no paid plan |
| 2026-05-28 | EE files: not activated | Community free tier; no Enterprise license |

## 12. Discrepancies — README vs code

| README / CONTRIBUTING / QUICKSTART claims | Code reality | Severity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| README quick-start: `npx n8n` (implies npm works) | `preinstall` script blocks `npm install` in the dev repo. `npx n8n` is for **end-user** install from npm registry — a different path. Dev setup must use `pnpm install`. | info (different audience; not a dev-path discrepancy) |
| CONTRIBUTING: "Node.js version 24 or newer is required" | `engines.node` in `package.json` says `>=22.22` | warn (CONTRIBUTING more restrictive; use Node 24 to be safe) |
| `.env.example` (common convention) | Actual file is **`.env.local.example`**, loaded via `dotenvx` (`pnpm exec dotenvx run -f .env.local -- <cmd>`), NOT a plain `cp .env.example .env` pattern | block (wrong filename breaks setup) |
| README: port 5678 (Docker example) | ✓ Confirmed — code binds 5678 | none |
| README: "400+ integrations" | `packages/nodes-base/nodes/` confirms many integration nodes | none |
| LICENSE.md: branches other than `master` not licensed | Not disclosed in README | warn (relevant for fork — all FlexNetOS work must stay on `develop`, never browse unlicensed branches for code) |
| No mention of telemetry in quick-start | PostHog + RudderStack wired into `base-command.ts` startup by default | info (can disable; not deceptive, but worth knowing) |
| CONTRIBUTING: `corepack prepare pnpm@10.22.0 --activate` | `engines.pnpm >= 10.22.0` — consistent | none |
